      <p class="story"> The Nashville Software School, responding to growing demand and an interest in night classes, is looking for a bigger space with an eye on Germantown, according to school founder John Wark.
"We've had a significant demand for evening classes," he said."We really need our own classrooms that we can program all day."
Wark opened the school last year, running classes out of a room at the Nashville Business Incubation Center downtown, and in June will graduate the second class of students, who seek to land entry-level jobs in software development, a sector in high demand for Nashville firms.
Wark said about 160 applicants have applied for as many as 30 spots in the next program that begins in September. He said there is increased interest from out-of-town applicants who have discovered the school, including those from the West and East coasts, as well as states in the Midwest.
"We are getting some people who used to live in Nashville, or who went to school in Nashville or who have family in Nashville wanting to come back to Nashville," he said. "[They] are seeing this as an interesting way to potentially make a career change or just get some training in something they are already interested in and maybe start a career in or move a career to Nashville."
Twenty-six students are on track to graduate at the end of June and will begin to look for jobs with area firms needing software developers. Wark said as many as 20 new companies have expressed interest in finding employees through the school since the last class graduated, and the strength of the program is improving with each new cohort.
"We learned a lot the first time through," he said. "The second time through you know more what you're doing."
Wark said he wants to add evening classes for professionals seeking to add to their skill set on top of running the full-time student program. A new location is necessary because the software school cannot stay in their current space after 4 p.m. each day.
"A lot of people say, 'I know I want to become a programmer, I've become exposed to Web development, but I am not going back to get a degree and I can't quit my day job,'" he said. "The demand has been very high."
Germantown is a good area because of its central location and because of its growing presence of tech companies, he said, adding no lease has been signed. Stratasan, Concept Technology Inc. and Bytes of Knowledge are among tech companies building their presence in that area.</p>
